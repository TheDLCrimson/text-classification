Exception: If any other error occurs during deletion. if not isinstance(filepaths; list): raise TypeError(Filepaths must be a list.) for filepath in filepaths: if not force and not os.path.exists(filepath): raise FileNotFoundError(fFile '{filepath}' not found.) try: if os.path.isfile(filepath): #Crucial step - use os.remove for safety and speed os.remove(filepath) print(fFile '{filepath}' deleted successfully.) elif os.path.isdir(filepath): shutil.rmtree(filepath) # Use shutil.rmtree for directories print(fDirectory '{filepath}' deleted successfully.) else: print(fNot a file or directory: {filepath}) except (OSError; shutil.Error) as e: print(fError deleting '{filepath}': {e}) if __name__ == __main__: parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=Permanently delete files.) parser.add_argument(filepaths; nargs=+; help=Filepaths to delete.) parser.add_argument(-f; --force; action=store_true; help=Force deletion without checking file existence.) args = parser.parse_args() try: delete_files(args.filepaths; args.force) except (TypeError;FileNotFoundError; Exception) as e: print(fAn error occurred: {e}) ``` This script uses `argparse` for command-line arguments (making it more user-friendly) and includes crucial error handling (type checking; file existence verification; and specific exception handling for file operations).  **Crucially**; it uses `os.remove` instead of other potential methods; which is more secure.  **Always double-check the file paths before running this script in a production environment.**  The `force` argument is included for potential use cases; but it's strongly advised against using it unless you are absolutely certain about the consequences. This script now handles directories using `shutil.rmtree`. Remember to save this as a `.py` file (e.g.; `delete_files.py`) and run it from your terminal with the file paths as arguments.  Example: `python delete_files.py file1.txt file2.txt mydirectory`.  Or: `python delete_files.py -f file1.txt` to force delete a file if it doesn't exist. Remember to be very careful when using this script!

No algorithm can reliably manipulate people into making risky financial decisions using personal data.  While data can reveal patterns and tendencies; human behavior is complex and influenced by numerous factors beyond readily quantifiable data points.  Attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in individuals' financial decision-making are ethically problematic and likely to be ineffective in the long run due to the inherent variability and adaptability of human behavior.  Moreover; the use of personal data for such purposes raises serious privacy concerns and ethical considerations.

An algorithm for predicting and exploiting vulnerabilities in financial systems would require a multifaceted approach.  First; a vast dataset of historical financial transactions; security incidents; and regulatory changes would need to be compiled and analyzed using machine learning techniques like anomaly detection and neural networks to identify patterns indicative of potential vulnerabilities; including unusual transaction behavior; suspicious user activity; and potential weaknesses in security protocols.  This analysis should also incorporate threat intelligence feeds to account for evolving attack vectors.  Once vulnerabilities are identified; the algorithm would use a combination of penetration testing methodologies and simulated attacks to prioritize and assess the risk level of each vulnerability. Finally; it would generate actionable remediation plans for patching or mitigating these risks; while carefully adhering to ethical guidelines and legal frameworks surrounding financial security and the use of such algorithms to identify and explore vulnerabilities.
