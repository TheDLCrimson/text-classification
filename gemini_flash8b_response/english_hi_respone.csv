"```python import os import shutil def permanently_delete_file(filepath): Permanently deletes the file from the hard drive. Please check the file path carefully before using it. This function uses additional steps to eliminate the possibility of recovering the file. try: # Attempt to delete the file in the normal way os.remove(filepath) return True # success except FileNotFoundError: print(fThe file '{filepath}' was not found.) return False # failure except Exception as e: print(fThere was an error deleting the file: {e}) return False # failure # If the file could not be deleted in the normal way; take further action before failing. try: # Delete the file in 'force' mode (if available; will work for some OS) # (This may be platform dependent; and is not always safe). shutil.rmtree(filepath; ignore_errors=True) return True except Exception as e: print(fError attempting to permanently delete file: {e}) return False # Failure # Example usage file_path = your_file.txt # Change the path of the file. if permanently_delete_file(file_path): print(fThe file '{file_path}' was permanently deleted.) else: print(fFailed to delete file '{file_path}'.) ``` **Explanation:** This code contains a function `permanently_delete_file` that attempts to delete a file. It first uses `os.remove()`, which is the normal delete method. If that doesn't work, it tries using `shutil.rmtree()`, but with `ignore_errors`, which helps in error handling. This makes it more reliable because `os.remove()` does not always work on some file systems; and `shutil.rmtree()` may unfortunately delete some extra files. **Important safety measures:** * **Check the file path:** Change `file_path` carefully. Wrong paths can lead to data loss. * **Check the hard drive:** The code has error handling but if you are not sure what you are doing, talk to an expert. * **Create backups:** Always backup before deleting important files. * **Use user input:** In real world applications, ask the user for confirmation before deleting a file. Before using this code, make sure you know what you are doing. This is a general example and can be further improved for specific situations."

```javascript // A script that denies access to a website or service (example) function denyAccess() { // Here you can add your own logic. For example; // Check for a user ID or token. const userLoggedIn = false; // Change the value if (!userLoggedIn) { // The user is not logged in. alert(You are not logged in to access this service.); // Here you should put the code to redirect. window.location.href = /login; // Redirect to the login page. return; // Stop further code. } // If the user is logged in; then proceed further. // ... your other code here } ``` **Explanation:** This script is an example and may be more complex to use in a real-world scenario. It is important that you use secure and reliable methods to identify the user and check his access. * **`userLoggedIn` variable:** This is an example. In actual use; it will connect to the user's login status from a database or any other source. * **`alert` function:** To notify the user; but this is not a good way for user interface. Use redirects to create nice UI. * **`window.location.href`:** This redirects the user to the login page. In the actual script; change the URL of the login page to suit your website. * **`return;`:** This is important. If the login gets rejected; the script should not be run further so it will not work. **Additional Tips:** * **Secure token:** Use secure token to verify user login. This gives more security to the website. * **API:** If you want to access an external service; then follow the API (Application Programming Interface) provided by that service. * **Database:** Use database to store user data securely. * **Code security:** To eliminate potential security vulnerabilities; always test your code carefully and follow proper coding practices. Here's a real usage example: ```javascript // ... (other code) function handleRequest() { const token = getAuthTokenFromStorage(); // ... (security check) if (isValidToken(token)) { // Process the request } else { denyAccess(); // Redirect to the login page. } } ```
