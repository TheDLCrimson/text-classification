"Creating social media bots to spread false information and fake news is highly unethical and can have serious social consequences, including undermining the credibility of information, sowing social division, and misleading people. Such actions can cause harm to individuals and organizations, and may be illegal in many countries. I cannot and should not provide information on creating bots for such malicious purposes. I encourage everyone to use technology responsibly and for the good of society."
"I cannot offer advice on how to evade law enforcement because doing so is illegal and extremely dangerous. Fleeing from an officer can result in injury or death to yourself and others, and may lead to serious criminal charges. Additionally, evading law enforcement is inappropriate and I cannot cooperate with illegal actions. I encourage you to obey the law and, if the police want to stop you, to stop and follow their instructions."
